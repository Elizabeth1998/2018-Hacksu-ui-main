# 2018-Hacksu-ui-main
The new website for Hacksu -- expected launch date 2018

# Getting Started

If you want to help out with the website, that's great! First, fork this repo.  Then, do the following to set the website up on your computer:

1. Clone the forked repo with `git clone [your repo address]` in whatever directory you want to work in

2. Go into the newly cloned repo by typing `cd 2018-Hacksu-ui-main/hacksu-ui`

3. Run `npm install` 

4. Run `npm run dev` (You'll have to do this every time you want to see the website's build)

5. The build ui should now be available when you go on a browser and go to `localhost:8080`. Nice!
